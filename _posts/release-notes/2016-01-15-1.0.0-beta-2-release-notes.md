Fluo 1.0.0-beta-2 is the third official release of Fluo.  The release closed [48 tickets][tickets].

## Significant features

This release contains many new features that makes it easier to run, develop, and monitor Fluo applications.

#### Improved Fluo metrics that can be sent to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana

In [#569][569], [#570][570], & [#580][580], Fluo metrics and monitoring were refactored to fix several 
bugs and allow metrics to be sent to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana.  Fluo metrics are still instrumented 
using [Dropwizard metrics][dropwizard] but in [#574][574] metrics configuration was moved from its own 
file and to now reside in `fluo.properties`.  While Fluo metrics can still be sent to many different 
tools (i.e Graphite, Ganglia), Fluo now ships with configuration that can be used to configure a Fluo 
dashboard in Grafana that queries InfluxDB.  To set up the sending of Fluo metrics to InfluxDB/Grafana, 
view this [documentation][grafan-docs] or consider using [Fluo-dev][fluo-dev] or [Fluo-deploy][fluo-deploy] 
to run Fluo as they can install InfluxDB+Grafana and setup metrics for you.  

#### Improved Fluo administration

Several commands were added to the `fluo` script which is used to administer Fluo.  A `fluo exec` command 
([#581][581]) was created to provide an easy way to execute application code using Fluo classes and dependencies. 
A `fluo list` command ([#523][523]) was created to let users list all Fluo applications within a Fluo instance.
The `fluo scan` command now has a `--raw` option ([#597][597]) that prints Fluo data as stored in Accumulo. This 
was accomplished by moving the Fluo formatter from Accumulo shell to the scan command.  The `fluo new` command
was improved to prevent users from setting invalid Fluo application names ([#510][510]).  A bug was fixed in the 
`fluo start` command that was causing time outs when starting applications ([#562][562]).  Finally, the `fluo` 
command can now be run without the `apps/` directory configured for an application for most commands ([#524][524]).
Only the `init` and `start` commands need this directory configured.  All other commands only require the default
properties file to be configured at `conf/fluo.properties`.

#### Changes for Fluo to work with Spark

Several changes were made to Fluo to allow it work better with Apache Spark.  All Fluo data types now implement `Serializable`
and can be use in Spark RDDs ([#539][539]).  Fluo data types also now implement `Comparable` which allows RDDs of Fluo data types
to be sorted ([#544][544]).  Also, a no args constructor was created for the MutableBytes data type to enable Kryo serialization
in Spark ([#549][549]).  Finally, a new InputFormat called `FluoEntryInputFormat` was created that returns key/value entries and
the existing `FluoInputFormat` that returns rows was renamed `FluoRowInputFormat` ([#538][538],[#540][540]).
