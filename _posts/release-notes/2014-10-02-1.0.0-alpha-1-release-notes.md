# Fluo Alpha 1 Release Notes

Fluo 1.0.0-alpha-1 is the first official release of Fluo. It contains 83 initial tickets marked for this first milestone. The roadmap for this release included a working initial implementation, completing an initial pass at the client API (which will be finalized in 1.0.0), and writing a stress test application.  This release has not been tested much at scale.  More scale and peformance testing will be done for the beta release.

## Significant features

This alpha release contained a lot of initial features to help establish the basic implementation and client API. All of these features will be expected to become more robust over time.

#### Cross Row Transactions

The ability to execute cross row transactions with snapshot isolation is a core feature mentioned in the [Percolator][percolator] paper. Fluo provides a robust implementation of this feature utilizing Accumulo's [conditional mutations][ACCUMULO-1000] introduced in Accumulo 1.6.0.  

#### MiniFluo

MiniAccumulo and MiniFluo make it easy to start a local Fluo instance for integration testing. MiniFluo also makes it easy for developers to experiment with Fluo locally without installing it on an Accumulo cluster.

#### Observer API

Notifications allow processing to be done on a worker as data is modified in one or more watched columns. The Observer API allows users to deploy their notification handling logic to the workers so that the code can be run server-side.

#### Garbage Collection

Without garbage collection, the columnns in a Fluo table would grow without bound as updates are applied over time. Because of this, it's important to clean up old fully-processed (and no longer being read) transaction data. The initial implementation of garbage collection kept N versions of columns. [Fluo-8][8] added the ability to garbage collect all column versions that are no longer being read by transactions anywhere else in the cluster.

#### MapReduce InputFormat

The FluoInputFormat allows a specific snapshot to be read into a mapreduce job. It was established in [Fluo-7][7].

#### FluoFileOutputFormat and FluoOutputFormat

The FluoFileOuputFormat enables the bulk ingest of a Fluo table using mapreduce by creating the Accumulo r-files in HDFS. The FluoOutputFormat pushes keys directly into the Accumulo tablet servers through the client API. [Fluo-35][35] added this feature.

#### Fluo Workers and Oracle running in Yarn

Fluo can use Yarn to manage fault tolerance and guarantee multiple worker processes and some number of Oracle processes are kept running across the cluster. [Apache Twill][twill] was used for the Yarn integration. [Fluo-11][11] added an application that will deploy Fluo to a Yarn cluster.

#### Oracle failover

The Oracle provides monotonically increasing transaction timestamps. Having multiple Oracles deployed on a cluster with the ability to failover is important to maintain high availability of Fluo transactions. [Fluo-15][15] and [Fluo-3][3] provide this.

#### Fluo API

Fluo provides a fluent-builder API for creating transactions to read and mutate data of various different data types in the Fluo table. This API was finalized in [Fluo-23][23] and [Fluo-98][98] when it was moved into its own module.  It includes a type layer (finished in [Fluo-153][153]) that makes it easier to work with different types, default values, null return types, and row/column maps.

#### Stress test

A [stress test][stress] was created that uses a tree to force collisions on transactions trying to mutate multiple columns at the same time. This was established in [Fluo-24][24].

Other important improvements and features:

* [Fluo-1][1]   - Create scripts for starting/stopping services
* [Fluo-13][13]  - Register clients that perform transactions in Zookeeper
* [Fluo-16][16]  - Allow observer notification to be configured in AbstractObserver class
* [Fluo-89][89]  - OracleApp should allow configurable number of instances
* [Fluo-98][98]  - Create a Range class for Fluo
* [Fluo-123][123] - Hide implementation of Bytes in the API
* [Fluo-130][130] - Expose MiniFluo in public API
* [Fluo-131][131] - Make LoaderExector implement closeable
* [Fluo-147][147] - Create fluo-accumulo module for Accumulo iterators and formatter
* [Fluo-175][175] - Add newTransaction() method to FluoClient
* [Fluo-186][186] - Add Exceptions to API

## Testing

All unit and integration tests passed.  Two [stress tests][stress] were run successfully on a 20-node cluster with one test generating 2000 integers and another generating 5000 integers.  The 5000 integer test took about 10 minutes to run after the MapReduce load of integers was complete.
