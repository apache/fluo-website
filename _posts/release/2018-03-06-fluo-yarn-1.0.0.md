title: Apache Fluo YARN 1.0.0 released
version: fluo-yarn-1.0.0
---

This is the first release of the [Apache Fluo YARN launcher][fluo-yarn] which runs Fluo applications in
[Hadoop YARN][YARN]. The YARN launcher was originally distributed with [Fluo][fluo]. It has been
moved to its [own project][fluo-yarn] as Fluo has multiple application launchers. Moving the code out
simplified Fluo and reduced its dependencies.

This release of the Fluo YARN launcher requires Fluo 1.2.0 or above. Future releases of Fluo should
work with this release as the YARN launcher uses minimal Fluo API. If not, a new release will be made. However,
new releases of the YARN launcher will likely be due to new releases of [Hadoop YARN][YARN] and [Apache Twill][Twill].
