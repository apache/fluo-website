The [1.0.0-beta-2][release] release is the third release of Fluo and likely the final
release before 1.0.0.

It contains the following significant improvements:

 * Fluo metrics were improved and can now be sent to InfluxDB and viewed in Grafana.
 * Improvements were made to Fluo to make it work better with Apache Spark.
 * Several performances improvements were made to decrease transaction commit time.
 * Fluo administration was improved with bug fixes and the addition of new commands.
 * Several improvements were made to the Fluo API.

Fluo is now at a point where its two cluster test suites, [Webindex][webindex]
and [Stress][fluo-stress], are running well for long periods on EC2.
