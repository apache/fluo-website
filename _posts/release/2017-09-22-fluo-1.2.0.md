Apache Fluo follows [semver](http://semver.org/) for its API . The API consists
of everything under the `org.apache.fluo.api` package. Code outside of this
package can change at any time. If your project is using Fluo code that falls
outside of the API, then consider [initiating a discussion](/getinvolved/)
about adding it to the API.

## Significant changes

The major changes in 1.2.0 are highlighted here, for the complete list of changes, see the [1.2.0
Milestone] on Github.

### Fluo now supports multiple ways for running Fluo applications

Before 1.2.0, Fluo applications could only be run in YARN or as local processes. For 1.2.0, the Fluo tarball
was refactored to support other ways of running Fluo applications such as Docker, Kubernetes & Marathon. This
refactoring has the following notable changes:

* The Fluo tarball is now designed for initializing Fluo and running local processes.
* The `fluo.properties` was deprecated and was replaced by `fluo-conn.properties` and `fluo-app.properties`.
  - `fluo-conn.properties` contains connection properties and is shared by Fluo applications
  - `fluo-app.properites` contains application-specific
* Code for launching Fluo applications in YARN was moved to its [own project][fluo-yarn] that has its own
  [release][fluo-yarn-release] tarball. The Fluo tarball can still be used to launch Fluo applications
  in YARN if a `fluo.properties` is created from `fluo.properties.deprecated`.

Read the [quickstart documentation][quickstart] to learn how to run Fluo application using these new methods.
