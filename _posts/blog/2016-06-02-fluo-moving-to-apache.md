Fluo was recently [proposed][1] as an Apache Podling.  The [vote][2] passed and
now we are in the process of moving to Apache.  See [INFRA-11900][3] for more
details.

Currently the only thing setup in Apache land is the mailing list.  If you
would like to subscribe to the new list, send an email to
[dev-subscribe@fluo.incubator.apache.org][4].  [Archives][5] of the list are also
available.
