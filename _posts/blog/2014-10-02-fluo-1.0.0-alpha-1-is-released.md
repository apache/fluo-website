The Fluo project is happy to announce the [1.0.0-alpha-1][1] release of [Fluo][2].

This is the first release of Fluo and is not ready for production use. We invite developers to try it out, play with the [quickstart][3] & [phrasecount][4] examples, and contribute back in the form of bug reports, new feature requests, and pull requests.

Fluo is an implementation of Google's [percolator paper][10], which adds large-scale incremental processing of data using distributed transactions and notifications. It runs on [YARN][5] using [Twill][9] and stores its data in [Accumulo][6]. 

[Release notes][7] and [javadocs][11] are available.  The [fluo jars][8] have been deployed to Maven Central
